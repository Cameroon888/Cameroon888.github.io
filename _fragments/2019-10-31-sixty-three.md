Sixty-Three.

I am really starting to like these short-form videos. They are easy to edit and relaxing to shoot. The memory card in my camera is only 500MB which means I have to be a lot more selective with my shots - I stop when I run out of space. I haven't quite sorted the sound yet, as Lightworks can't process .avi sound, apparently. I'll try and sort that for the next one, but for now I think it's okay as is.
