_Upright_
-

Pinching the skin around my knuckles

I see my skeleton and wonder for whom it stands

~

With you, I’ve a voice in my ribs,

Teeth in my shoulder,

A bushel of bones, intertwined and singing

~

Alone, they hang lazily, crown to toe

A bloody bag of potentials

That I’d truss up and hand to you,

To re-arrange with more beautiful intent
