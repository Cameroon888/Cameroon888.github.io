_Forecast_
-

Sometimes, at night, it showers:

The heavens open above my quiet city

As water fills the cracks and carries off the dust

~

Tarmac furrows are flushed through,

Coaxing the soil and the seeds

To forgive me in the Spring

~

I hold up my beaded hands, smiling

Because I know at last that theyâ€™re true -

My mind and body are liquid, like I knew

~

In time, it breaks.

The clouds part to the sky

And my puddles are splashed to the pavement
