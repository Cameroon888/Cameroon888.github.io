This is a slideshow of my trip around Europe this summer. Along the way, I took lots of pictures (with my phone), collected scraps of paper, and also recorded bits of background noise from each country I visited (I brought a Zoom mic with me). Then, after a bit of editing, I put everything together and organised it into separate chapters for each country.

It may not be particularly ground-breaking, but I think it came out really nicely. I really enjoyed recording the sound, and after looking through the photos when I got back, it was satisfying to see how much I had improved over the 2.5 months. It was also useful to work on my sound editing skills ahead of 'Likeness', which I am editing at the moment.
