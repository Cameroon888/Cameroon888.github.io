My name is Cameron and I'm a filmmaker based in London.

I created this site to share what I'm currently working on and to archive my past work in a way that gives you an intimate understanding of who I am, and what goes into the films I make.

There are past projects here and fragments of current projects that may or may not amount to anything, as well as some references that I think are interesting and fun.

Unless I make some kind of mistake, I'll never take anything down from this site. I'd like to be as honest as possible about my creative process, and show that not everything I make is - or has to be - particularly good. I'm always trying things out, and this website should reflect that.

Look around as much as you'd like x
