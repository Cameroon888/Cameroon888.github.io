My name is Cameron and I'm a student/filmmaker based in London.

I started this website in the hope of showcasing the things I am currently working on in a way that gives you more of an understanding of who I am and what goes into the films I make.

There are old projects here, as well as fragments of current projects that may or may not become anything, and some material I like to refer to.

Look around as much as you'd like x
