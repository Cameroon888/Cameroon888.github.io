My name is Cameron and I'm a student/filmmaker based in London.

I created this site in the hope of sharing the things I am currently working on and archiving my past work in a way that gives you an intimate understanding of who I am, and what goes into the films I make.

There are past projects here as well as fragments of current projects that may or may not amount to anything, and some material I find interesting/useful.

Unless I make some kind of mistake, I will never take anything down from this site. I'd like to be as honest as possible about my creative process, and show that not everything I make is - or has to be - particularly good. I'm still trying things out, and this website should reflect that.

Look around as much as you'd like x
